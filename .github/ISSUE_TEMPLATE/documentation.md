**Checklist**
- [ ] I have checked both ReadMe.md and the repository Wiki for documentation
- [ ] Choose one:
  - [ ] Documentation is _wrong/has errors_
  - [ ] Documentation is _is lacking information_
  - [ ] Documentation is _is missing completely_

**What needs improving**
[Explain what documentation you have an issue with. What feature/workflow does it apply to?]

**Additional Information**
[Screenshots or other information you think is relevant]
